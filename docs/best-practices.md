## For Project Teams with Technical Skills

If your team has technical expertise and development capabilities, you have the flexibility to choose your deployment approach based on your specific needs and preferences.

### Self-Deployment Option

**When to Choose Self-Deployment:**

- Your team has blockchain development experience
- You want full control over the deployment process
- You need custom configurations or modifications
- You prefer to manage your own infrastructure

**Prerequisites:**

- Familiarity with smart contract deployment
- Understanding of [OpenZeppelin Governor contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/governance)
- Experience with blockchain development tools
- Access to necessary development resources

**Recommended Steps:**

1. **Try our demo**: Visit our [DeGov.AI Demo](https://demo.degov.ai) to explore the platform's features and capabilities
2. **Review the documentation**: Read the [Integration Overview](integration/overview.md) to understand the workflow of deploying a DAO
3. **Prepare configuration parameters**: Follow the [Parameters Guide](governance/parameters/overview.md) for your DAO setup
4. **Deploy and configure**: Use our [Deployment Guide](integration/deploy.md) to deploy smart contracts and set up your DAO

**Best Practices:**

- Always test governance parameters thoroughly before mainnet deployment
- Implement proper multi-signature controls for critical operations
- Plan for upgrade paths and governance evolution
- Document your customizations for future maintenance

### Assisted Deployment Option

Even with technical skills, you might prefer our assisted deployment service for:

- **Time Efficiency**: Focus on your core business while we handle deployment
- **Expert Guidance**: Benefit from our experience with DAO deployments
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduce deployment risks with our proven processes
- **Ongoing Support**: Access continuous technical support post-deployment

**How to Request Assistance:**

1. **Contact our team** through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov/issues) or [Telegram Group](https://t.me/RingDAO_Hub) 
2. **Provide project details** including your requirements and technical setup:
    - Blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum, Darwinia)
    - Desired governance parameters (voting periods, quorum, etc.)
    - Any specific customizations needed
3. **Schedule a consultation** to discuss your DAO's governance needs
4. **Collaborate on planning** for customization and deployment

## For Governance Learners

If you're interested in learning more about DAO governance concepts, mechanisms, and best practices, or want to understand how to participate in governance, our comprehensive documentation is your starting point.

### Learning Path

#### **Start Here: Governance Fundamentals**
- [Introduction to DAOs](governance/intro/daos.md) - Understanding decentralized autonomous organizations
- [Governance Models](governance/intro/model.md) - Different approaches to DAO governance
- [On-chain vs Off-chain Governance](governance/intro/onchain-offchain.md) - Understanding the trade-offs

#### **Dive Deeper: Governance Parameters**
- [Parameters Overview](governance/parameters/overview.md) - Understanding key governance settings
- [Proposal Thresholds](governance/parameters/proposal-thresholds.md) - Setting barriers for proposal creation
- [Voting Periods](governance/parameters/voting-period.md) - Optimizing voting timeframes
- [Quorum Requirements](governance/parameters/quorum.md) - Ensuring legitimate decision-making
- [Timelock Delays](governance/parameters/timelock-delay.md) - Security through delayed execution
- [Proposal Delays](governance/parameters/proposal-delay.md) - Giving stakeholders time to prepare

#### **Master the Process: Proposal Lifecycle**
- [Proposal Overview](governance/proposal/overview.md) - Understanding the proposal system
- [Proposal Lifecycle](governance/proposal/lifecycle.md) - From creation to execution
- [Delegation](governance/proposal/delegation.md) - Representing stakeholder interests
- [Voting Mechanisms](governance/proposal/voting.md) - How decisions are made

### Learning Best Practices

**For Beginners:**

1. Start with the fundamental concepts before diving into technical details
2. Use our examples and case studies to understand real-world applications
3. Engage with the community to ask questions and share insights
4. Practice with testnet deployments to gain hands-on experience

**For Advanced Learners:**

1. Study the trade-offs between different governance parameters
2. Analyze successful DAOs to understand effective governance patterns
3. Contribute to discussions about governance improvements
4. Consider participating in governance as a delegate or voter

**Stay Updated:**
