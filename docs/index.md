# What is DeGov.AI?

[DeGov.AI](https://degov.ai/) is a next-generation governance platform that leverages **AI agents** to empower Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Our mission is to help DAOs cultivate vibrant communities and make more informed, effective decisions.

## Key Features

*   **Built on OpenZeppelin Governor:** DeGov.AI leverages the battle-tested [OpenZeppelin Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/governance) framework. This provides a robust, secure, and community-trusted foundation for your DAO's governance. Existing DAOs using OpenZeppelin Governor can seamlessly transition to DeGov.AI.
*   **AI-Powered Governance:** AI agents are integrated directly into the governance workflow. These agents can perform a range of tasks, from simplifying complex proposals through summarization and providing insightful feedback, to connecting with real-world data sources with [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) to enrich community engagement and decision-making.
*   **Open Source & Community-Driven:** DeGov.AI is an open-source project. We believe in transparency and collaboration, inviting everyone to inspect, modify, and contribute to our [codebase](https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov).
