# What is DeGov.AI?

[DeGov.AI](https://degov.ai) is an AI-powered governance platform designed for DAOs that use the [OpenZeppelin Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/governance) framework. 
What sets DeGov.AI apart is its [agent governance](./governance/agent/overview.md) feature, which allows AI agents to participate in the governance process, enhancing decision-making and community engagement.

## Key Features

* **Agent Governance:** DeGov.AI introduces a unique agent governance model where AI agents are not just tools but active participants in the governance process. These agents can analyze proposals, provide insights, and even vote on behalf of the community, ensuring that decisions are informed by data and AI-driven analysis. See our [Agent Governance Overview](./governance/agent/overview.md) for more details.
* **Open Source & Community-Driven:** DeGov.AI is fully open source, allowing anyone to inspect, modify, and contribute to the codebase. You can even clone the repository and run it yourself. See our codebase on [GitHub](https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov).
* **Built on OpenZeppelin Governor:** DeGov.AI leverages the battle-tested [OpenZeppelin Governor](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/governance) framework. This provides a robust, secure, and community-trusted foundation for your DAO's governance. Existing DAOs using OpenZeppelin Governor can seamlessly transition to DeGov.AI.
