# Overview

DeGov introduces AI Agent Governance, a novel approach that sets it apart from traditional governance solutions like [Tally](https://www.tally.xyz) or [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org). Our platform features a specialized AI agent that not only analyzes proposals but also actively participates in the governance process, for instance, by voting on behalf of the community.

This AI-driven approach is designed to:

- Enhance community engagement
- Reduce operational costs
- Ensure efficient and effective proposal evaluation

For a detailed comparison with other platforms, see:
