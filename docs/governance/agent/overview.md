<!-- First, there is a special role called "DeGov Agent" in the delegates page in the DeGov app, it allows community members to delegate their voting power. Once there is a new proposal created, the degov agent service will create a post attached a voting choice poll and poll time on the X to receive X user's preference for this proposal. For the X users, they can vote on the poll and comment on the post to express their opinions. Before the proposal voting ends, the DeGov Agent will collect the poll results and comments, and then analyze them to made a final decision and vote representing all the members who delegated their voting power to the DeGov Agent. -->

# Overview

The AI agent governance is a must have for the DeGov as the first day of the DeGov launch. We have noticed there are some hard problems in the decentralized governance area, such as the low participation rate of the community members, the difficulty in explaining the proposals to the community members, and the high cost of the governance process. We have some ideas to solve these problems with the AI capabilities, that's what the AI agent governance is for.

In this section, we will give an comprehensive explanation of the AI agent governance in the DeGov, including how it works, what are the benefits, and how to use it.
