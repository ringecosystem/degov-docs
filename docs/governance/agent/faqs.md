#### Who controls the private key of the agent?

Currently, the private key of the agent is controlled by the RingDAO team. We may consider decentralizing the control of the agent in the future, but for now, it is managed by the team to ensure the integrity and reliability of the agent's operations.

#### Will the agent is available for all DAOs on the DeGov platform?

There is no exact answer to this question. The agent service is developed as a plugin https://github.com/ringecosystem/degov-essential and work together with the DeGov platform. As the degov is open source, anyone can deploy their own degov instance. If you want to use the agent service, you need to maintain a extra agent service to work with your degov instance. By default, for all the DAOs created on the DeGov platform, the agent service is available and can be used by the community members to delegate their voting power to the agent.
