## What special about the DeGov Agent?

The DeGov Agent is unique in the sense that it is not just a delegate manipulated by a single individual, but rather a AI powered agent that can analyze the proposal either on-chain or off-chain, and vote before the proposal voting ends. 

Besides this, nothing is special about the DeGov Agent, it is just like any other delegates in the list, it can receive delegation from the community members.

Currently, there is only one DeGov Agent in the DAO in the DeGov platform.

It has a fixed avatar and name, which is "DeGov Agent", and it is always the first one in the delegates list. 

## Receive Delegation From Community Members

Just like any other delegates, the DeGov Agent can receive delegation from the community members. The community members can delegate their voting power to the DeGov Agent by clicking the "Delegate" button on the DeGov Agent's profile page, and then sign transaction to confirm the delegation.

In this way, the community members don't need to monitor the proposals all the time, they can just delegate their voting power to the DeGov Agent, and the agent will take care of the rest. he DeGov Agent will vote on their behalf based on the analysis of the proposal and the community discussions before the proposal voting ends.
