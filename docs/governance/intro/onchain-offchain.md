# Onchain and Offchain Governance

In the realm of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and blockchain-based systems, governance refers to the mechanisms by which decisions are made and implemented. This can broadly be categorized into onchain and offchain governance.

## Onchain Governance

Onchain governance embeds decision-making rules and procedures directly within the blockchain protocol. All stages—from proposal creation and voting to outcome execution—transpire on the blockchain. This method is central to DeGov.AI's philosophy, prioritizing maximum transparency, immutability, and trustlessness. DeGov.AI's onchain governance ensures decisions are binding, transparent, and immutable, automatically executed by smart contracts. It utilizes secure OpenZeppelin Governor contracts and token-weighted voting (ERC20/ERC721) within a formal proposal lifecycle (creation, delay, voting, timelock, execution). This model minimizes reliance on trust, automates implementation, offers clarity, and enhances censorship resistance. Nonetheless, it faces challenges like transaction costs (gas fees), slower processing due to block confirmations and voting periods, potentially reduced participation from smaller token holders because of costs and formality, and inflexibility in modifying governance rules, which also necessitates a protracted onchain procedure.

## Offchain Governance

Offchain governance encompasses decision-making processes conducted outside the blockchain, typically involving forum discussions, community calls, or polls on platforms like Snapshot for signaling sentiment. While these preliminary stages occur offchain, a designated multi-signature wallet or administrative body might implement the final decision onchain. Primarily, offchain governance acts as a tool for gauging community sentiment rather than directly enacting onchain changes. Its main benefits include flexibility through diverse discussion and polling tools (e.g., Discourse, Discord, Snapshot), cost-efficiency by avoiding gas fees, and rapid sentiment gathering, which promotes quick iteration and inclusivity by lowering participation hurdles. This approach facilitates more detailed discussions and qualitative feedback. However, it also has drawbacks: it depends on trusted entities to translate consensus into onchain actions, offchain polls can be less secure and prone to manipulation, decisions lack inherent binding power, and discussions risk fragmentation across various platforms.

## Comparing Onchain and Offchain Governance

| Feature             | Onchain Governance (DeGov.AI)                                  | Offchain Governance                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution**       | Automatic, by smart contract                                   | Manual, requires trusted party to implement onchain       |
| **Binding**         | Decisions are binding and automatically enforced               | Decisions are signals, non-binding without onchain action |
| **Cost**            | Incurs gas fees for transactions                               | Generally free or very low cost                           |
| **Speed**           | Slower, tied to block times and voting periods                 | Faster, informal polling and discussion                   |
| **Transparency**    | Fully transparent and auditable on the blockchain             | Varies by platform; discussions may be public or private  |
| **Security**        | High, inherits blockchain security; Sybil-resistant            | Lower, depends on platform; potential for manipulation    |
| **Participation**   | Can be lower due to cost/complexity                            | Often higher due to ease of access and low cost           |
| **Flexibility**     | Less flexible; rule changes require onchain votes              | Highly flexible; tools and processes can adapt quickly    |
| **Trust**           | Trust in code and protocol                                     | Trust in community, multi-sig holders, or platform admins |
| **Primary Use Case**| Formal proposals, treasury management, protocol upgrades       | Community sentiment, informal polls, discussion, ideation |

## The DeGov.AI Approach: A Hybrid Model

While DeGov.AI champions onchain governance for its robustness and trustlessness, it recognizes the value of offchain mechanisms for community engagement and initial proposal shaping. A typical workflow in the DeGov.AI ecosystem might look like this:

1. **Ideation & Discussion (Offchain)**: New ideas are discussed on community forums (e.g., Discourse, Discord) that can be linked in you `degov.yml` via `offChainDiscussionUrl` and create a entrypoint in the DeGov.AI UI. Discussions gather rough consensus and feedback from the community.
2. **Formal Proposal (Onchain)**: If there's strong offchain support, a formal proposal is created on DeGov.AI. This involves creating a detailed proposal that outlines the exact actions to be taken by smart contracts.
3. **Voting (Onchain)**: Token holders (or their delegates) vote on the proposal directly on the blockchain using DeGov.AI. This is where gas costs are incurred, and votes are cryptographically secured.
4. **Execution (Onchain)**: If the proposal passes (meeting quorum and threshold requirements) and the timelock period completes, the proposal is automatically executed by the DeGov.AI smart contracts.

This hybrid approach combines the inclusivity and agility of offchain discussions with the security and finality of onchain execution, creating a comprehensive and effective governance model.

## Conclusion

Both onchain and offchain governance play crucial roles in the lifecycle of a DAO. Onchain governance provides the secure and transparent foundation for making binding decisions, as exemplified by DeGov.AI. Offchain governance offers a flexible and accessible layer for community discussion, sentiment gathering, and initial proposal development. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each, DAOs can design governance systems that are both robust and responsive to their community's needs. DeGov.AI is designed to seamlessly integrate with offchain discussion channels to facilitate this balanced approach.
