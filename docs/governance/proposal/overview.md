# Proposal Overview

Think of governance proposals as the community's way of making important decisions together. Just like how a neighborhood association might vote on new community rules or how to spend shared funds, DeGov.AI uses proposals to let everyone have a say in how the platform evolves.

## What is a Governance Proposal?

A governance proposal is simply a suggestion that the community votes on. Anyone who holds enough governance tokens can suggest changes, and then everyone gets to vote whether they agree or disagree. It's democracy in action, but for a digital community!

## Types of Proposals

Governance proposals can cover a wide range of topics. Here are some common categories:

### Protocol Parameter Changes
- Adjusting operational rules (e.g., voting periods, quorum requirements).
- Modifying system settings and operational limits.
- Fine-tuning how the underlying protocol or system functions.

### System Upgrades & Improvements
- Introducing new features or functionalities.
- Addressing identified bugs or security vulnerabilities.
- Upgrading core infrastructure or technology.

### Treasury & Fund Management
- Allocating funds from a community-controlled treasury.
- Funding development grants, new projects, or ecosystem initiatives.
- Compensating contributors or service providers.

### General Community & Policy Decisions
- Ratifying partnerships or collaborations.
- Endorsing community-led initiatives or working groups.
- Establishing or amending community guidelines or charters.

## What Goes Into a Proposal?

Every proposal needs to include several pieces of information:

### Clear Description

A good proposal explains:

- What exactly is being suggested
- Why this change would be helpful
- How it might affect the community
- When it would be implemented

### Action Plan

The proposal can attach specific actions that will be executed if it passes. This is an important part because it tells everyone exactly what will happen if the proposal is approved. It might include:

- Which smart contracts will be called
- What functions will be executed
- How much money will be spent (if applicable)


!!! tip "Writing Good Proposals"
    The best proposals are easy to understand and explain clearly what will happen. Remember, the community needs to understand what they're voting for!

## Who Can Create Proposals?

To maintain quality and prevent spam, not just anyone can submit a proposal. Aspiring proposers must hold a minimum number of governance tokens. This requirement demonstrates a vested interest in the community's well-being and goals. The specific token amount needed is determined by the [proposal threshold](../parameters/proposal-thresholds.md), which is set by the community.

## How Proposals Get Unique Names

Each proposal gets a special fingerprint (called an ID) that's created from its contents. This ensures:

- No two identical proposals can exist
- Proposals can't be changed after creation
- Everyone can verify what they're voting on

## The Journey of a Proposal

Proposals go through several stages:

1. **Waiting to Start**: Newly created proposals have a brief waiting period before voting begins
2. **Active Voting**: Community members cast their votes
3. **Counting Results**: The system checks if enough people voted and if the proposal passed
4. **Approved**: Successful proposals enter a safety waiting period
5. **Ready to Execute**: After the waiting period, approved changes can be implemented
6. **Complete**: The proposal has been fully implemented

For more details about these stages, see our [Proposal Lifecycle](lifecycle.md) guide.

## How to Get Involved

Ready to participate in governance? Here's how to start:

### Step 1: Get Governance Tokens
You'll need to own some governance tokens to participate in voting.

### Step 2: Activate Voting Power
This involves a simple process called "delegation" - even if you're voting for yourself.

### Step 3: Stay Informed
- Follow community discussions
- Read proposal descriptions carefully
- Ask questions if something isn't clear

### Step 4: Vote Thoughtfully
- Take time to understand each proposal
- Consider how changes might affect the community
- Vote on proposals that interest you

### Step 5: Track Progress
- Watch how proposals develop
- See which ones get implemented
- Learn from the process
